# Mycelial Mass
## documentation and software used to automate the operation of small scale mushroom cultivation.

### Motivation
this project was born out of the unnatural fusion of two loves, code and mushrooms. included in this repository are the various tools and records we've used to cultivate gourmet and medicinal mushrooms on a small scale. we hope they will be useful to someone else.

### Design and Architectural Considerations
the project is designed to be an extensible system of containers, which the end user can pick and choose between based on their needs and interests. the exception is the microcontroller code, which naturally runs on bare metal.

### Disclaimer
please only use this technology to cultivate fungus that is legal in your locality. if you grow naughty mushrooms and get in trouble, that is 600% not our fault.
